# Feng 497-498 - Kill Bill - Graduation Project

Kill Bill has an objective of people can access to the water and electricity meters’
information at any certain time and it helps people learn their bill cost. This system supports
people to learn billing fees instantly and usage information of their own. One of the important
economic problem for households, industrial companies, public institutions is the real value of
the cost of bills. Therefore, with the regular increases in bill costs, people may face unexpected
prices at the end of the month. Kill Bill is a software project that is divided into two in itself;
Raspberry Pi and the mobile application part. Raspberry Pi part is responsible for taking photos
from the relevant meters and processing values for the mobile application usage. Mobile
application part related to the taking values from the Raspberry Pi system and gives the
calculated bill to the end users. These are the two different processes, but they work for the
same project that is called "Kill Bill".
